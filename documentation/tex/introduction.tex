Drug name recognition (DNR) is a critical step for drug information extraction.
DNR is the first step to identifying unknown drug interactions (DDI).
DDI is broadly described as a change in the effects of one drug by the presence of another drug.
Because of the lack of labeled corpora, early studies on DNR are mainly based on ontologies and dictionaries.
To promote the research on drug information extraction, MAVIR research network and University Carlos III of Madrid in Spain organized two challenges successively: \textbf{DDIExtraction 2011} and \textbf{DDIExtraction 2013}. 
Both of the two challenges provide labeled corpora that can be used for machine learning-based DNR.\\
We are presenting several approaches to solve \textbf{SemEval-2013 Task 9.1 and Task 9.2}.
