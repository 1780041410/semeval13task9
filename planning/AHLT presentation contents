	- task 9.1: statement & inspiration papers
	- task 9.1: approaches, 
				how we organized exploration and model selection
				our pipeline(components schema) and automated report

	- task 9.1:svm approach: Features used
**		- feature structure
		- summary table:
		[- task 9.1:svm approach: Features used, zoom on lookup,]
			description and links and preprocessing
		[- task 9.1:svm approach: Features used, zoom on chunk,]
			quick nltk + NP chunker 
		[- task 9.1:svm approach: Features used, zoom on w2v]
*			decription download, number of features, ..

	- task 9.1:crf approach: Features used
**		- feature structure: by sentence & how crf work
*			-> schema of the features
		- ???? forgot now which features are used!! -> same? word, lemma, pos, ortho
		- exploration made on the features

	- task 9.1:approach: NER result tables
*			best 3 models (or best models that are also diverse)
			winners and losers of the semeval task
			seeing the list of features in the table


	- task 9.2: statement & inspiration papers
	- task 9.2: svm approach: Features used,
		- the feature structure: by pair-sentence
		- features: entity ortho,word, pos, lemma, 
					parsed tree + shortest path + trigram +  frequency + appearance of 
*						-> example, schema!,
*						-> cite the source!
					parsed tree + shortest path + word +  frequency + appearance of 
*						-> example schema!
* 		- workflow: multiple preprocessings of train and test then training,  probably pipeline as it's different (compoenents) 


	- task 9.3: svm approach: DDI result table and comments
*			best 3 models (or best models that are also diverse)
			winners and losers of the semeval task
			seeing the list of features in the table


	- Conclusion:
		- what worked
		- possible improvements
			- testing other algorithms: like neural networks

			- improvements on our work
				- 9.1 svm apply clustering on w2v so to have a less memory demanding feature
				- cross-validation
*				- 9.2 add orthografic , lemma, pos of othe words in the sentence
*				- perform feature selection through other techniques:
					- feature frequency in the dataset
					- compute feature entropy
					- explore: statistical tests, correlation,PCA
